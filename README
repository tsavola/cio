/**
@mainpage Cooperative I/O routines


CIO is a C library for I/O-driven cooperative multitasking that tries to
abstract away the event loop.  Applications are partitioned into multiple
routines which have their own stacks.  The routines do blocking I/O calls
during which other routines are executed.  The routines can communicate and
synchronize between one another using channels.  This approach is related to
concepts like Communicating Sequential Processes, Continuations and Coroutines.

Currently only Linux on x86-64 is supported.  The scheduler doesn't know
multithreading yet.
